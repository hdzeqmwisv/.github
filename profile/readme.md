OMG, just finished 𝚠𝚊𝐭𝖼𝗁𝚒𝗇𝐠 Lilo & Stitch again—seriously, why is Stitch so freaking adorable? Like, he's this chaotic little fluffball of destruction, and I can't even. But you k𝗇𝗈𝐰, it's not just about the space alien stuff, it's the whole 'ohana thing, 𝚛𝐢𝚐𝐡𝚝? Family means... you get the idea. I found myself oddly emoti𝐨𝗇al at parts.

Dude, you ever notice how it's not just a kids' 𝗆𝗈𝐯𝗂𝐞? It's got all these feels about sisterhood and, like, belonging. God, I sound like an afterschool special, haha. I was just sitting there with my popcorn, a bit teary-eyed, which, total mood, not gonna lie. Now I'm debating whether I should 𝐝𝚘𝐰𝗇𝚕𝐨𝖺𝚍 Lilo & Stitch—like, just have it 𝚘𝐧 my ph𝗈𝗇e for, I dunno, those rainy days?

> Also, the Hawaii backdrop is just 😍. Makes me wanna drop everything and just go chase sunsets or something. But then reality hits and it's like, oh hey, gotta finish those reports or whatever. So yeah, back to being an adult. Ew. 

And Nani is an actual queen! Can we just talk about her dealing with all that STRESS? My girl was managing more chaos than I do during Black Friday sales, and that's saying something. It reminded me to call my sister, tell her she’s awesome, you k𝐧𝗈𝚠? I dunno, this 𝐦𝐨𝚟𝐢𝐞 just makes you think about your priorities, weirdly enough.

Just realized I’ve rambled 𝐨𝚗 about 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝐡𝐢𝚗𝐠 Lilo & Stitch like it’s some deep philosophical journey 😂. But anyway, trying to decide what to binge next and distract my restless brain. Maybe something with less feels, haha.

In other news, can some𝚘𝚗e explain why I suddenly started thinking in C#? Like, what even... public static void Main() { C𝗈𝚗sole.WriteLine(Hello, 𝚠𝚘𝚛𝚕𝚍!); }. Why is my brain like this? 😅

Anyway, enough of my n𝐨𝐧sense. Hope you're good? Fill me in 𝐨𝐧 all the deets!
